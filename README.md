# Canvas
project to combine canvassing returns, electoral register data and membership information

Running the try7.py file should create a new file within a db (named as you choose) which lists the 7 people who live in the ward now, taking into account that 3 people Bob Rimmington, Natisha Morris and Thomas Morris have left.

Try it.
